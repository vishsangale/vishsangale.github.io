Machine Learning, Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Astronomy and Photography intrigue me. Apart from these, I enjoy reading books and hiking. Collecting currencies of different countries is also one of my hobbies. Everybody likes to watch movies, Sitcoms. I am no exception to that. I am also fond of eating at different places. Currently, I am looking for new job opportunities in SFO bay area. I have completed my Master of Science at Colorado State University studying AI and Computer Vision. I had a very cool job at Giesecke and Devrient, Pune. I was working there from August 2011 to July 2014 as a Software Developer. My primary job was to design and implement low level drivers for smartcard controllers. I have also worked on boot loaders for these controllers. I have also co-founded a start-up called Genius Electronics in 2010, which was primarily focusing on Industrial Automation. I have completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics & Telecommunication in June,2011 from the University of Pune, India. I have been part of the MIT Tech Team, while pursuing my undergrad studies in MIT, Pune. And we have also represented India in International Robotics Competition called Robocon, 2010 in Egypt. I love astronomy. I love to go for a star gazing. I was also part of association of amateur astronomers called JVP, which organizes many events in Pune. Currently, I live in Mountain View.
