Implemented a NIC simulator. Offload capability implies that some of the higher-layer functionality (e.g., IP fragmentation and encapsulation, or even some of the transport functions) may be carried out in the NIC. The NIC considered here is a TCP offload engine that performs  large-segment offload and large-receiver offload in addition to normal NIC functions. Studied the performance of a NIC using an event-driven simulator.
