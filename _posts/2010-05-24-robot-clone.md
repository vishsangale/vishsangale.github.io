Built two robots which cloned wirelessly such that one can copy others. Used RF transmitters and receivers in ISM band to send the data given to first robot maneuvering so that second can copy its action. Developed the Embedded system on AVR based microcontroller and circuit design and PCB design, done using CadSoft EAGLE PCB Design Software.
