Derivation of the masks from motion detection as a source of constraint for face detection in a video. Used Haar and LBP(Local Binary Patterns) cascade classifiers from OpenCV for face detection. Carried out quantitative empirical analysis for detecting the performance of the classifiers. Generated motion detection masks from the video for restricting the region of interest for face detection.
