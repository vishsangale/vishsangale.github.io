This project, developed a simple overlay-based solution that allows a set of nodes to share resources among each other. The main goals are generating network topology and designing searching algorithm to locate interesting items. Used UDP for communication between nodes. Generated search queries using Zipfâ€™s distribution. Studied the performance parameters of the network with different scale of network.
