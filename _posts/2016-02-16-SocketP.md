This project, studied the sockets for communicating over the internet . Connectionless iterative server created using UDP and Connection-oriented Concurrent Server created using TCP for handling multiple clients at a time. Formation of Overlay Network using Socket Programming on PlanetLab. PlanetLab is an open, globally distributed platform for developing, deploying and accessing 
planetary-scale network services. Created an overlay network using nodes in planetlab. Client-Server architecture is used for creation of Overlay network. Studied the network parameters studied like Round Trip Time(RTT), network load.
