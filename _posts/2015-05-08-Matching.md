For feature detection, used SURF(Speeded Up Robust Features) as a local feature detector and descriptor. Used FLANN based matcher for feature matching used, which internally uses nearest neighbor search algorithm. Cumulative Match Characteristic curves are generated  and studied from the distance matrix generated for different video snippets.
