Built a robot capable of localizing its position in real time on any terrain using Gyroscope and odometry with Extended Kalman Filter. It focussed on the accurate localization using ARM7 based embedded design with ARM7 micro-controller, Embedded System designed using LPC
2148 ARM7 controller interfacing gyroscope, rotary encoders, Motor drivers. Designed using CadSoft EAGLE PCB Design Software.
