This project, studied the performance for several variants of the perceptron algorithm like with bias, without bias, pocket algorithm and applying gradient descent to the perceptron criterion. Analyzed accuracy of the perceptron algorithm for the above algorithms. Explored the effect of data normalization by scaling the features.
