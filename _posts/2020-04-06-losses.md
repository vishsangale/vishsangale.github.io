##Mean Square Error Loss (MSE)

- Also known as Quadratic loss or L2 loss
- Regression problem
- Typical activation function : Linear

## Mean Square Log Error Loss

## Mean Absolute Error Loss (MAE)

- L1 loss
- Regression problem
- Typical activation function: Linear

## Mean Bias Error Loss (MBE)

- Regression problem
- Typical activation function: Linear

## Hinge Loss

- SVM loss
- Binary classification
- Used for max margin classifiers
- Typical activation function: Sigmoid

## Squared Hinge Loss

## KL Loss
- Kullback Leibler Divergence Loss
- Multi-Class classification

## Cross-Entropy Loss

## Negative log-likelihood

## Weighted Cross-Entropy

## Balanced Cross-Entropy

## Binary Cross-Entropy Loss

- Binary classification
- Typical activation function: Sigmoid

## Multi-Class Cross-Entropy Loss

- Multi-Class classification
- Typical activation functionL Softmax
## Sparse Multi-Class Cross-Entropy Loss

## Huber Loss

- Smooth Mean Absolute Error
- Less sensitive to outliers than squared error loss

## Dice Loss

## Focal Loss

## Tversky loss

## Focal Tversky loss

## Log Cosh Loss

## Quantile Loss
