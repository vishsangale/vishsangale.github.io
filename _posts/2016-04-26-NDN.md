This project explained how Named Data Networking can be used to support file sharing and synchronization without centralization. This application exercised NDNs efficient multicast dissemination and intrinsic content signatures. It relied on NDNs intrinsic content caching and multicast mechanism to achieve reduction in congestion as compared to IP-based P2P approaches. Implemented a P2P file sharing application over NDN and deduced the properties of NDN architecture.
